Here is an overview of the models we implemented/tried:

1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Logistic Regression
4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
5. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Network
6. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
7. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Pre-trained Model
8. Word Embedding Techniques:
    - Bag of Words
    - Character N-Grams
    - Doc2Vec
    - Deep IR (Information Retrieval) Model
   The overall accuracy ranges from 50% to 73%, depending on the data extraction.
